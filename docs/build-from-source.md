Building from Source
---
- Make sure you have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed and updated (`rustup install`/`rustup update nightly`)
- Clone the repo from Github
- run `cargo build --release` in the repo's folder
- Put the `static` folder in the same location as the generated executable (`target/release/frcscouter.exe`)
- Enjoy!
